Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile! I'd love to share a bit about myself.

Work ðŸ”­
I'm a Frontend Developer specializing in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Angular. I'm actively seeking junior developer roles where I can contribute to impactful projects and broaden my skill set.

Education ðŸŒ±
I recently completed an intensive web development training at Developer Akademie in Munich. The course was project-based, focusing on JavaScript, Angular, and Front-End development.

Interests ðŸ¤”
Aside from web development, I have a strong background in interior construction, which equips me with a unique perspective on project planning and execution. My journey in IT began when I developed a website for our family business.

I'm particularly interested in building scalable and user-friendly applications. I love the challenge of transforming complex problems into simple, intuitive solutions.
